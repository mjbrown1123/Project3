Hello!

These are all files used in Project 3. I run the Arduino program (listed as "test_connect_gyro.ino") on an Arduino UNO and
the Processing Program (listed as "Wireless_STL_Rotation.pde") on my laptop, which is connected to the Arduino. Every other file is run on
a website run on heroku (link = http://creativecodingvr.heroku.com/index.html). Happy VRing!
